## Introduction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. The primary algorithms used include Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can be useful for real estate analysis.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
- You can install the required packages using pip: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
  - Feature1: Description of Feature1
  - Feature2: Description of Feature2
  - Feature3: Description of Feature3
  - Price: Target variable - Price of the house
- Note: Replace "Feature1", "Feature2", etc., with actual feature names and descriptions relevant to your dataset.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into the following files:
- data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- model_training.py: Includes code for training the Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor models.
- model_evaluation.py: Contains code for evaluating the model performance.
- visualization.py: Includes functions for visualizing data and results.
- main.py: The entry point of the application that ties everything together.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
- Data Preprocessing: python data_preprocessing.py
- Model Training: python model_training.py
- Model Evaluation: python model_evaluation.py
- Visualization: python visualization.py

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Linear Regression:
  - Fit a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
  - Evaluate using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Gradient Boosting Regressor:
  - Fit a Gradient Boosting Regressor model using scikit-learn.
  - Evaluate using the same metrics as above.

## Results
  - Linear Regression: Provide summary statistics, performance metrics, and any relevant insights.
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor: Provide summary statistics, performance metrics, and any relevant insights.
- Note: Include specific results, graphs, or tables here based on your actual findings.
